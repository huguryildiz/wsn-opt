Maximization of Wireless Sensor Networks Lifetime via Linear Programming

This code simulates the lifetime maximization problem for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using a linear programming approach.
MATLAB is used to construct the network and energy models, while GAMS is used to build the linear programming model and for the solution.

The code starts from main.m.

Please read the following link to interface GAMS and MATLAB:
